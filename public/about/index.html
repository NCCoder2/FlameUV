    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Flame Network. Our goal is to unblock and bypass school restrictions, giving freedom to students. We unblocked NOW.GG, allowing you to play Roblox and many other games. And remember this is currently the only proxy that supports now.gg. Unblock, Bypass, Evade</p>

    <h2>Plans</h2>
    <p>Flame Network is awaiting many changes, for a better user friendly experience. These changes include faster proxy load times, a supporting now.gg proxy without a residential hosting platform, the addition of games, and much more. With now.gg proxy support deployable on any service, we can add more links and add more features.</p>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>Flame Network was started by https#3021, he provides the residential hosting platform allowing for now.gg to work on this proxy. And the the 2 other devs are AldessSc#9187 and NC Gaming#8436. <br> This frontned was developed by NC Gaming#8436</p>
